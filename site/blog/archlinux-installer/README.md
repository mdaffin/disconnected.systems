title: 'Automating Arch Linux Part 3: Creating a Custom Arch Linux Installer'
---

In this three-part series, I will show you one way to simplify and manage
multiple Arch Linux systems using a custom repo, a set of meta-packages and a
scripted installer. Each part is standalone and can be used by its self, but
they are designed to build upon and complement each other each focusing on a
different part of the problem.

- **Part 1:** Hosting an Arch Linux Repo in an [Amazon S3 Bucket] or [Hosted Git Repository]
- **Part 2:** [Managing Arch Linux with Meta Packages]
- **Part 3:** *Creating a Custom Arch Linux Installer*

The Arch Linux install process can be quite daunting to new users, but once you
understand it, it becomes quite elegant in its simplicity. The best part is
that it's command line based with very little abstraction built on top of it.
This makes it very easy to automate through bash scripting and over the years I
have done just that. In this post, I will go through this script and show you
how to custom it to your own tastes.

Note that this is not a general purpose Arch Linux installer, but more a guide
to creating your own installer specific to your needs. I do not recommend
directly using my installer - it is likely to change without notice. Instead,
fork it and make it your own.

This guide is also not a tutorial on installing ArchLinux, it assumes some
basic knowledge of the install process and shows you how to script it.
Beginners should first go through the [offical install guide] and be able to
create a working Arch Linux system before following this guide.

## Setting Variables and Collecting User Input

There are a few variables that generally change on every install, the hostname
and disk at the very least. There are also settings that you might not want to
bake into a script such as your username and password. So we require a way to
customise the script on each install. The simplest way is to add some variables
to the top of the script for everything you want, blanking out any secrets you
don't want to share.

```bash
hostname="myhost"
```

But then the user is forced to download and edit the script before they can run
it.

You can get these values from the command line arguments.

```bash
hostname="${1}"
```

Or better yet, throw an error and halt the install process on missing input.

```bash
hostname="${1:?"Missing hostname"}"
```

*There are many other useful things you can do with [bash's parameter
substitution], which are worth looking up if you want to write bash scripts to
automate things.*

But I always forget the order of these arguments, so I prefer to be prompted
for input. You can do this with the `read` builtin.

```bash
echo -n "Hostname: "
read hostname
: "${hostname:?"Missing hostname"}"
```

Note that `:` is a no-op, we are using it to test the validity of the
`hostname` variable and to exit early if it is blank (ie the user hit enter
without typing anything).

For passwords, you should turn off echoing with `-s`, echo a blank line (as the
new line char is also not printed) and confirm the password with a second
prompt to avoid typos locking the user out accidentally.

```bash
echo -n "Password: "
read -s password
echo
echo -n "Repeat Password: "
read -s password_2
echo
[[ "$password" == "$password2" ]] || ( echo "Passwords did not match"; exit 1; )
```

But the Arch live disk comes with the dialog utility, this opens up another
option for collecting user input.

```bash
hostname=$(dialog --stdout --inputbox "Enter hostname" 0 0) || exit 1
: ${hostname:?"hostname cannot be empty"}
```

Or use `--passwordbox` instead of `--inputbox` for passwords. Dialog also lets
us do more complicated things like displaying a list of disks for the user to
pick from.

```bash
devicelist=$(lsblk -dplnx size -o name,size | grep -Ev "boot|rpmb|loop" | tac)
device=$(dialog --stdout --menu "Select installtion disk" 0 0 0 ${devicelist}) || exit 1
```

![dialog disk selection](/blog/archlinux-installer/01-dialog-disk.png)

In addition to looking fancy, this also helps to reduce typos and requires less
typing. The list is sorted by reverse size so the disk you want is likely at
the top of the list.

## Partioning and Formatting the Disk

Most people are familiar with `fdisk` or `gdisk` for partitions their disk. But
you might want to consider their lesser used sisters, `cfdisk` and `cgdisk` if
you prefer a more interactive approach. Whichever you prefer you can launch it
with a disk to let the user format it however they want.

```bash
gdisk "${device}"
```

This works fine in side a script, you are able to interact with it like you are
user to, but when it exits our script will continue.

The major problem with these interactive approaches is figuring out the
formatting and layout they user wants or expected for that install. You are
mostly forced to ask the user what they want to do with each partition they
created, which complicates the script and install process quite a bit. Or just
assume a layout and hope the user formatted it correctly.

Alternatively, if most or all of your systems are formatted identically you can
hardcode the layout into the script. This keeps the script simpler and means
there are fewer steps to go through when installing a system. In the event you
do need a custom disk layout for a single system you can download and manually
edit the script or even delete the formatting section entirely and formatting
it manually beforehand.

```bash
parted --script "${device}" -- mklabel gpt \
  mkpart ESP fat32 1Mib 129MiB \
  set 1 boot on \
  mkpart primary linux-swap 129MiB 2177MiB \
  mkpart primary ext4 2177MiB 100%
```

You can make this more flexible by allowing the user to speficy the size of the
ESP or swap space, or even calcualte the swap basied on the available ram.

```bash
swap_size=$(free --mebi | awk '/Mem:/ {print $2}')
swap_end=$(( $swap_size + 129 + 1 ))MiB

parted --script "${device}" -- mklabel gpt \
  mkpart ESP fat32 1Mib 129MiB \
  set 1 boot on \
  mkpart primary linux-swap 129MiB ${swap_end} \
  mkpart primary ext4 ${swap_end} 100%
```

Note that I work in MiB to allow parted some freedom to align the partitions
correctly and as such add an extra meg to the size to account for rounding
errors.

Before we can format the partitions, we need a reference to their device file.
For most systems this is trivial, just add the partition number to the device
file.

```bash
part_boot="${device}1"
```

But I found a couple of systems that this does not work. Instead, you may need
to add `p1` to the device file instead. You should be familiar with this if
your system is one of them, but generally, this is laptops with `/dev/mmcblk0`
or `/dev/nvme0n1` disks.

```bash
part_boot="${device}p1"
```

To generalise over these two types of disks you can use `ls` and `grep` to find
and filter the actual partition. I found the bashes globbing was not powerful
enough to filter out just a single partition while ignoreing device files such
as `/dev/mmcblk0boot1` that also exist on some of these systems.

```bash
part_boot="$(ls ${device}* | grep -E "^${device}p?1$")"
```

Once you have identified the partitions, format and mount them to your desired
locations.

```bash
mkfs.vfat -F32 "${part_boot}"
mkswap "${part_swap}"
mkfs.f2fs -f "${part_root}"

swapon "${part_swap}"
mount "${part_root}" /mnt
mkdir /mnt/boot
mount "${part_boot}" /mnt/boot
```

Note that if you want swap you should enable the swap partition so that
`genfstab` picks it up correctly.

## Install the System and Bootloader

We are ready to pacstrap the system with any and all packages you want on your
final system. I use the meta-packages I created in [part 2], which will, in
turn, install all the packages I want on my base system. For this, I need to
append my repo to the end of `/etc/pacman.conf` before running `pacstrap`.

```bash
cat >>/etc/pacman.conf <<EOF
[mdaffin]
SigLevel = Optional TrustAll
Server = $REPO_URL
EOF

pacstrap /mnt mdaffin-desktop
```

Now to make our system actually bootable we must install a bootloader. I use
UEFI on my systems and as such use `bootctl`. For commands that you want to run
inside the context of your installed system wrap them with `arch-chroot /mnt`.

```bash
arch-chroot /mnt bootctl install

cat <<EOF > /mnt/boot/loader/loader.conf
default arch
EOF

cat <<EOF > /mnt/boot/loader/entries/arch.conf
title    Arch Linux
linux    /vmlinuz-linux
initrd   /initramfs-linux.img
options  root=PARTUUID=$(blkid -s PARTUUID -o value "$part_root") rw
EOF
```

## Configuring the System

The last thing we need to do is configure the system. This stage is quite short
for my systems as most of the work is done by the meta-packages that I created
in [part 2]. If you choose not to use meta-packages then expand this as much as
you require. You can automate the configuration of your entire set up if you
want to or bootstrap configuration managers like [SaltStack] or [Ansible] if
you want to get really fancy.

[SaltStack]: https://saltstack.com/
[Ansible]: https://www.ansible.com/

At a minimum run `genfstab`

```bash
genfstab -t PARTUUID /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab
```

Set your hostname

```bash
echo "${hostname}" > /mnt/etc/hostname
```

Create a user and set roots password

```bash
arch-chroot /mnt useradd -mU -s /usr/bin/zsh -G wheel,uucp,video,audio,storage,games,input "$user"
arch-chroot /mnt chsh -s /usr/bin/zsh

echo "$user:$password" | chpasswd --root /mnt
echo "root:$password" | chpasswd --root /mnt
```

## Other Useful Bits

There are a couple of other bits in the script that have nothing to do with
installing Arch Linux but improve the error handling and make it easier to
debug problems.

First, there is my standard preamble, hardening the [script against
failure][bash strict mode], which if you have been following my posts you
should start to recognise.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -uo pipefail
trap 's=$?; echo "$0: Error on line "$LINENO": $BASH_COMMAND"; exit $s' ERR
```

And since the terminal on a live USB does not offer the ability scrolling by
default it is easy to lose the output and errors from programs as they scroll
off the screen. Most of the time this is not an issue, but when something goes
wrong you wish you had it. To get around this I redirect stdout and stderr of
the script to the `tee` command. This splits the stream, continuing to output
it to the screen but also writes it to a log file in case there is a need to
inspect it later. Honestly, I have only ever used this output once, but it is
not expensive or complicated to do so I just leave it in.

```bash
exec 1> >(tee "stdout.log")
exec 2> >(tee "stderr.log")
```

I also ensure ntp is enabled as I have systems that like to drift when
unpowered for a long time.

```bash
timedatectl set-ntp true
```

## The Complete Installer Script

Here is my version, at the time of writing, of the installer script in its
entirety. You can find my [live/latest incarnation] in my [arch-pkgs] git
repository alongside all of the other resources I discuss in this series. I
highly recommend that you start with this as a base, fork it or place it in
your own repo and customise it to your liking. My version is likely to change
in the future as I evolve how I run my systems.

## Hosting and Running the Installer

Running the script is as simple as downloading it from the Arch Linux live
USB/CD and running the script. To make this easier, since you often cannot copy
in the live environment, you can use a URL shortener such as git.io or goo.gl
to make the URLs easier to type. *Remember to use the raw link to the script if
you host it on github or similar sites.* Once you have the URL I recommend
adding it to the top of the script or a README in the repo for easy reference
later.

Here is the curl line I use in my script.

```bash
curl -sL https://git.io/vNxbN | bash
```

You can also download the script, modify it if required and run it locally.
This can be useful when setting up a system that diverges slightly from your
standard setup or if you want to customise it further.

## Conclusion

Now you have fully automated the Arch Linux install process, and when combined
with my [previous][part 1] [posts][part 2] in this series, the whole
configuration side of things as well. I have been using this script in some
form or another for several years now and the best part of it is how easy it is
to hack and change either before you download the script or just before you run
it.

You can even take this a step further and bake the installer into a [custom
arch iso][archiso]. But I did not find this worth the effort unless you want to
automate the installation of Arch Linux on multiple identical systems, such as
running Arch with a kiosk browser on a bunch of monitors.
